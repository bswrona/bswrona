- 👋 Hi, I’m @bswrona
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, starting with the basics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html through the w3 website. I've realized I'm a visual learner, not learning through lectures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, but any/all help would be great.
- 📫 How to reach me: bswrona@gmail.com
